•	Supported Lipid Bilayer Systems Stabilization by Undulatory-Protrusion Forces, and Destabilization by Lipid Bridging- In this study the suspension/precipitation process of zwitterionic lipid/SiO2 nanosystems was analyzed as a function of ionic strength and as a function of the ratio of lipid/SiO2 surface areas. (January 2011)

•	Cationic Supported Lipid Bilayers for DNA Transfection-This focuses on using the SLBs (Supported lipid bilayers) as DNA and gene delivery agents to cancerous cells. (February 2011)
